							<h3>Summary</h3>							
							<p>When I started this project, I was still relatively new to using WordPress as a content management system. I was tasked with transferring the content from an outdated CMS over to WordPress. Because we were on a limited time, we opted to modify a template to fit the brand direction. It is still a work in progress, and we are currently in the processing of making some SEO adjustments.</p>
							
							<h3>Process</h3>
							<p>We began by looking at how the original website was organized, and made a copy of all the content before creating a basic WordPress install. Then we used a the Kallyas theme as our starting template. After that it was a matter of setting up and styling the pages and navigation. This gave the website a more modern look and feel and 100% responsive.</p>
							
							<h3>Result</h3>
							<p>Although it is always a work in progress, so far the response to the site has been positive, and was regarded as a necessary upgrade from the old design.</p>
